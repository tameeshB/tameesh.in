Originally started in 2009 it sprang up as a much celebrated tournament of IIT Patna. The thrill and competition which the event had witnessed has grown enormously during the recent years and could be clearly seen in the fifth edition this year. Whether it be the "Pythons" taking on the "Bolts" or the "Invincibles" taking on the "Falcons" every match has witnessed the enormous talent which the players had displayed.<br><br>
                        Thus PPL league provides the platform for players to display their talents and improve their skills thereby achieving the purpose for which it was established as well as providing a break from the strenuous curriculum and helping in the all-round development of the individual.
