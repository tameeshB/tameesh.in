Leaving for IIT Patna today,<br>
Mixed feelings,<br>
Getting a wave of excitement but also upset (about leaving home, kinda).<br>
Mumbai is where I was born and brought up,<br>
It is a great city, developed and everything,<br>
not sure how Patna is going to be, new city, new people, never been there before.<br>
Might take time to adjust there. :/
